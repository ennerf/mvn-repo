h1. What is this ?

This is an unofficial repo for open source projects that can't currently be found in managed maven repositories.

h2. Why ?

Every once in a while I require a dependency that can't be found in maven central. Because using non-mavenized dependencies can get very messy, I've ended up deploying dependencies into my own  private repository until the various projects support maven. I'm in the process of making some of this publicly available so that others might save some time.

Feel free to use my repo, but understand that I'm not affiliated with any of the projects and that artifacts might not be kept up to date. I'll update to new versions as needed. 

If you think some artifact should be updated, please let me know or push the change in yourself.

Artifacts in this repo have an -unofficial postfix in order to avoid naming collisions in the future. The sources corresponding to these artifacts can be found here https://github.com/ennerf/mvn-project .
