h1. What is this ?

This is an unofficial repo for some open source projects that can't currently be found in managed maven repositories. I'm not affiliated with the hosted projects and thus can't upload them directly to maven central.

h2. Why ?

Every once in a while I require a dependency that can't be found in maven central. Because using non-mavenized dependencies can get very messy, I've ended up deploying dependencies into my own  private repository until the various projects support maven. I'm in the process of making some artifacts publicly available so that others might save some time.

Feel free to use my repo, but understand that I'm not affiliated with any of the projects and that artifacts might not be actively maintained.

Artifacts in this repo have an -unofficial postfix in order to avoid naming collisions in the future.

h2. Updating Artifacts

Normally I'll update versions as needed, so projects that I use infrequently might end up being out of date. If you think that some artifact should be updated, please let me know or push the change in yourself.

The sources I used to create these artifacts can be found here https://github.com/ennerf/mvn-projects. The readme contains info on how to deploy new versions.
